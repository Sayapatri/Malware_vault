# Python Script to List and Encrypt Files
This is a simple Python script that lists all files in the current directory, encrypts the data inside each file using the cryptography module's Fernet encryption, and saves the encryption key in a separate file named key.key.

## Encryption Script v

The mal.py script generates a random encryption key using Fernet.generate_key() and saves it to a file named key.key. It then iterates through all files in the current directory (excluding key.key, encrypt.py, and decrypt.py files) and encrypts the data within each file using the encryption key. The encrypted data is then written back to the same file.

To run the encryption script, open your terminal and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python mal.py
## Decryption Script

The dec.py script reads the encryption key from the key.key file, iterates through all files in the current directory (excluding key.key, encrypt.py, and decrypt.py files), reads the encrypted data within each file, decrypts the data using the encryption key, and writes the decrypted data back to the same file.

To run the decryption script, open your terminal and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python dec.py
## Requirements

To run these scripts, you will need:

Python 3.x
cryptography module (you can install it using pip install cryptography command)
Please note that the encryption key saved in the key.key file is essential for decryption. Ensure that you do not lose the key or delete it.
